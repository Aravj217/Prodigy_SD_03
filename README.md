This project is a Contact Management System built using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. It allows users to add, view, update, search, and delete contact information such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses. The system is entirely text-based and runs within the notebook, making it easy for beginners to follow and interact with. It uses core Python concepts like lists, dictionaries, functions, loops, and conditional statements to manage data efficiently. The contact information is stored either in memory or through basic file handling for persistence, depending on the version. This project is not a standalone app but a functional and educational program that helps learners understand how to structure small-scale data management systems using Python. To get started, open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially to use the features.
